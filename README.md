# XDCCParser-ng
Next Generation XDCC Parser for iroffer-dinoex

## About XDCCParser-ng

XDCCParser-ng is a pure Javascript packlist indexer for iroffer-dinoex. This is a rewrite/fork of the original XDCC Parser-Global into a more modern, pure HTML+Javascript page.

XDCCParser-ng provides several advantages over the original XDCC Parser as it can be served with nothing but a static webserver. No CGI required!

It also provides advantages over [uguu/xdccparser](https://github.com/uguu/xdccparser/) as it does not need iroffer to be compiled with Ruby and HTTP server support.
